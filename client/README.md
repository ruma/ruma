**ruma-client** is a low-level [Matrix][] client library for [Rust][].

[Matrix]: https://matrix.org/
[Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/

## Status

This project is a work in progress and not ready for production usage yet. If you are looking to
build a client application or a bot, you are likely going to have a better time using the Matrix
Rust SDK, which also builds on the other Ruma crates but provides a higher-level API.
