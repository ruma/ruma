# 0.17.0 (unreleased)

Breaking changes:

* Update the syntax of the `ruma_api!` macro. Colons are now required after the keywords `metadata`,
  `request` and `response`.
* The `EndpointError` trait now requires `std::error::Error`. This allows integrating
  `EndpointError`s in the common rust error ecosystem like `thiserror` and `anyhow`.
* The `Endpoint` trait has been replaced by four of new traits that each capture a subset of its
  previous functionality: `OutgoingRequest`, `OutgoingResponse`, `IncomingRequest`,
  `IncomingResponse`. See the API documentation for more details.
* Endpoint authentication is now more granularly defined by an enum `AuthScheme`
  instead of a boolean. The `ruma_api!` macro has been updated to require
  `authentication` instead of `requires_authentication`.
* Remove `error::Void`, the default error type for `ruma_api!` is now `error::MatrixError`
  (see below)

Improvements:

* The `EndpointError`s that come with ruma crates now implement `std::errror::Error`
* Add a new `MatrixError` type to the `error` module that consists of a HTTP status code and JSON
  `body` and is the new default error type for `ruma_api!`

Bug fixes:

* Prevent panic when building requests with an invalid URI  

# 0.16.1

Bug fixes:

* Update ruma-serde to 0.2.0, fixing some issues with query string deserialization (some issues
  still remain but will be fixed in a semver-compatible version)

# 0.16.0

Breaking changes:

* Update ruma-identifiers to 0.16.1
* Remove the `Outgoing` trait and update the `Endpoint` trait and code generation accordingly

Improvements:

* Remove dependency on the `url` crate

# 0.15.1

Bug fixes:

* Write `{}` to the body of responses without body fields (fix from ruma-api-macros)

# 0.15.0

Breaking changes:

* Emit an error on non-UTF8 characters in path segments
  * Before, they would be replaced by the unknown character codepoint
* `FromHttpResponseError` now has a generic parameter for the expected type of
  error the homeserver could return

Improvements:

* Enable deserialization of unsuccessful responses

# 0.14.0

Breaking changes:

* Update ruma-api-macros to 0.11.0
  * This includes a fix that uses `TryFrom<&str>` instead of serde_json for path segment
    deserialization

# 0.13.1

Improvements:

* Update ruma-api-macros to 0.10.1
  * `Incoming` types will now implement `Debug`

# 0.13.0

Breaking changes:

* Instead of one `Error` type, there is now many
  * The new types live in their own `error` module
  * They provide access to details that were previously hidden
* Our Minimum Supported Rust Version is now 1.40.0

# 0.12.1

Improvements:

* Update ruma-api-macros to 0.9.1 to support `#[ruma_api(raw_body)]`

# 0.12.0

Breaking changes:

* Our Minimum Supported Rust Version is now 1.39.0
* Support for the server-side use case has been restored. For details, see the documentation for
  `ruma_api!`, the new `Outgoing` trait and its derive macro

# 0.11.2

Improvements:

* Update ruma-api-macros to 0.8.2

# 0.11.1

Improvements:

* Update ruma-api-macros to 0.8.1

# 0.11.0

Breaking changes:

* To be able to use ruma-event's `EventResult` in ruma-client without large-ish refactorings to ruma-api, we removed support for the server-side use case in ruma-api 0.11.0. It will be added back in a future release.

Improvements:

* Our CI now tests ruma-api on Rust 1.34.2, beta and nightly in addition to stable
* Updated syn and quote to 1.0

# 0.10.0

Breaking changes:

* The `Endpoint` trait is now implemented directly on the relevant request type rather than having both the request and response be associated types.

Improvements:

* ruma-api now re-exports the `ruma_api` macro from ruma-api-macros. Downstream crates no longer need to depend on ruma-api-macros directly.
* The ruma-api and ruma-api-macros repositories have been merged into one Cargo workspace for easier dependency management and development.

# 0.9.0

Breaking changes:

* The `Request` and `Response` associated types on the `Endpoint` trait are now bounded by `std::convert::TryFrom` instead of `futures::future::FutureFrom`. This was done in preparation for futures 0.3 which does not have this trait.
* The conversions required to and from `http::Request` and `http::Response` for the `Request` and `Response` associated types on the `Endpoint` trait now use `Vec<u8>` as the body type. This removes the dependency on hyper. It's possible this will change again in a future release. See https://github.com/rustasync/team/issues/84 for details.

Improvements:

* Internal code quality improvements via clippy and rustfmt.

# 0.8.0

Breaking changes:

* The `Error` type is now an opaque struct that hides implementation details.
* Updates to ruma-identifiers 0.13.

Improvements:

* ruma-api now uses clippy to improve code quality.

# 0.7.0

Improvements:

* ruma-api now runs on stable Rust, requiring version 1.34 or higher.
* Updated all dependencies for upstream improvements.
* Updated all code to use Rust edition 2018.

# 0.6.0

Breaking changes:

* Hyper has been updated to version 0.12.
* A new variant to the `Error` enum for hyper errors has been added.
* Conversions between this crate's request and response types and the http crate's request and response types are now bidirectional.

# 0.5.0

Breaking changes:

* Types from hyper have been replaced with types from the http crate.
* The `Error` enum can no longer be matched exhaustively, to allow for future expansion without breaking the crate's API.

# 0.4.0

Breaking changes:

The crate has been redesign to focus on conversions between an endpoint's request and response types and Hyper request and response types. Implementations are expected to be generated via [ruma-api-macros].

# 0.3.0

Breaking changes:

* `Endpoint::router_path` now returns a `&'static str`
* Added new required methods to `Endpoint`: `name`, `description`, `requires_authentication`, and `rate_limited`.

# 0.2.0

Breaking changes:

* `Endpoint::Query_params` must now be `Deserialize + Serialize`.

# 0.1.0

Initial release.
