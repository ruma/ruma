# [unreleased]

Improvements:

* Add `receipt::ReceiptType`

# 0.5.0

Breaking changes:

* Rename `push::RulesetIter` to `push::RulesetIntoIter`
* Change the return type of `push::Ruleset::get_actions` from an iterator to a
  slice

Improvements:

* Add `push::Ruleset::iter()` for borrowing iteration of rulesets
* Add conversions between `AnyPushRule` and `AnyPushRuleRef`
  (`AnyPushRule::as_ref` and `AnyPushRuleRef::to_owned`)
* Add `push::Ruleset::get_match()` for finding the first matching push rule for
  an event. This is pretty much the same thing as `get_actions()` but returns
  the entire push rule, not just its actions.

# 0.4.0

Breaking changes:

* Use `ruma_identifiers::MxcUri` instead of `String` for `avatar_url` field in
  `directory::PublicRoomsChunk`
* Use `ruma_identifiers::RoomId` instead of `String` for `room_id` field in
  `push::PushConditionRoomCtx`
* Upgrade ruma-identifiers dependency to 0.19.0

# 0.3.1

Bug fixes:

* Fix `push::PushCondition::applies` for empty value and pattern

# 0.3.0

Breaking changes:

* Update set of conversion trait implementations for enums
* Replace `Vec` by `IndexSet` in `push::Ruleset`
* Replace `push::AnyPushRule` with an enum (the original struct still exists as
  just `PushRule` in `ruma-client-api`)
* â€¦ (there's a lot more, but this changelog was not kept up to date; PRs to
  improve it are welcome)

Improvements:

* Add the `thirdparty` module
* Add `directory::{Filter, PublicRoomsChunk, RoomNetwork}` (moved from
  `ruma_client_api::r0::directory`)
* Add `push::{PusherData, PushFormat}` (moved from `ruma_client_api::r0::push`)
* Add `authentication::TokenType` (moved from
  `ruma_client_api::r0::account:request_openid_token`)
* Add an `IntoIterator` implementation for `Ruleset`
* Add `push::Ruleset::get_actions`
  * Add `push::PushCondition::applies`
  * Add `push::{FlattenedJson, PushConditionRoomCtx}`

# 0.2.0

Breaking changes:

* Make most types defined by the crate `#[non_exhaustive]`
