//! (De)serializable types for the events in the [Matrix](https://matrix.org) specification.
//! These types are used by other Ruma crates.
//!
//! All data exchanged over Matrix is expressed as an event.
//! Different event types represent different actions, such as joining a room or sending a message.
//! Events are stored and transmitted as simple JSON structures.
//! While anyone can create a new event type for their own purposes, the Matrix specification
//! defines a number of event types which are considered core to the protocol.
//! This module contains Rust types for all of the event types defined by the specification and
//! facilities for extending the event system for custom event types.
//!
//! # Core event types
//!
//! This module includes Rust types for all event types in the Matrix specification.
//! To better organize the crate, these types live in separate modules with a hierarchy that matches
//! the reverse domain name notation of the event type. For example, the `m.room.message` event
//! lives at `ruma::events::room::message::RoomMessageEvent`. Each type's module also contains a
//! Rust type for that event type's `content` field, and any other supporting types required by the
//! event's other fields.
//!
//! # Extending Ruma with custom events
//!
//! For our examples we will start with a simple custom state event. `ruma_event`
//! specifies the state event's `type` and it's [`kind`](EventKind).
//!
//! ```rust
//! use ruma_common::events::macros::EventContent;
//! use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
//!
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Deserialize, Serialize, EventContent)]
//! #[ruma_event(type = "org.example.event", kind = State, state_key_type = String)]
//! pub struct ExampleContent {
//!     field: String,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This can be used with events structs, such as passing it into
//! `ruma::api::client::state::send_state_event`'s `Request`.
//!
//! As a more advanced example we create a reaction message event. For this event we will use a
//! [`OriginalSyncMessageLikeEvent`] struct but any [`OriginalMessageLikeEvent`] struct would work.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use ruma_common::{
//!     events::{macros::EventContent, OriginalSyncMessageLikeEvent},
//!     OwnedEventId,
//! };
//! use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
//!
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
//! #[serde(tag = "rel_type")]
//! pub enum RelatesTo {
//!     #[serde(rename = "m.annotation")]
//!     Annotation {
//!         /// The event this reaction relates to.
//!         event_id: OwnedEventId,
//!         /// The displayable content of the reaction.
//!         key: String,
//!     },
//!
//!     /// Since this event is not fully specified in the Matrix spec
//!     /// it may change or types may be added, we are ready!
//!     #[serde(rename = "m.whatever")]
//!     Whatever,
//! }
//!
//! /// The payload for our reaction event.
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Deserialize, Serialize, EventContent)]
//! #[ruma_event(type = "m.reaction", kind = MessageLike)]
//! pub struct ReactionEventContent {
//!     #[serde(rename = "m.relates_to")]
//!     pub relates_to: RelatesTo,
//! }
//!
//! let json = serde_json::json!({
//!     "content": {
//!         "m.relates_to": {
//!             "event_id": "$xxxx-xxxx",
//!             "key": "üëç",
//!             "rel_type": "m.annotation"
//!         }
//!     },
//!     "event_id": "$xxxx-xxxx",
//!     "origin_server_ts": 1,
//!     "sender": "@someone:example.org",
//!     "type": "m.reaction",
//!     "unsigned": {
//!         "age": 85
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! // The downside of this event is we cannot use it with event enums,
//! // but could be deserialized from a `Raw<_>` that has failed to deserialize.
//! assert_matches::assert_matches!(
//!     serde_json::from_value::<OriginalSyncMessageLikeEvent<ReactionEventContent>>(json),
//!     Ok(OriginalSyncMessageLikeEvent {
//!         content: ReactionEventContent {
//!             relates_to: RelatesTo::Annotation { key, .. },
//!         },
//!         ..
//!     }) if key == "üëç"
//! );
