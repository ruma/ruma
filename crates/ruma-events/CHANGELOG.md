# [unreleased]

Bug fixes:

- Fix deserialization of `AnyGlobalAccountDataEvent` for variants with a type
  fragment.
- Fix serialization of `room::message::Relation` and `room::encrypted::Relation`
  which could cause duplicate `rel_type` keys. 
- `Restricted` no longer fails to deserialize when the `allow` field is missing
- Markdown text constructors now also detect markdown syntax like backslash
  escapes and entity references to decide if the text should be sent as HTML.

Improvements:

- Add support for encrypted stickers as sent by several bridges under the flag `compat-encrypted-stickers`
- Add unstable support for MSC3489 `m.beacon` & `m.beacon_info` events
  (unstable types `org.matrix.msc3489.beacon` & `org.matrix.msc3489.beacon_info`)
- Stabilize support for muting in VoIP calls, according to Matrix 1.11
- All the root `Any*EventContent` types now have a `EventContentFromType` implementations
  automatically derived by the `event_enum!` macro.

Breaking changes:

- `StickerEventContent::url` was replaced by `StickerEventContent::source` which is a `StickerMediaSource`

# 0.28.1

Improvements:

- Implement `make_for_thread` and `make_replacement` for
  `RoomMessageEventContentWithoutRelation`
- `RoomMessageEventContent::set_mentions` is deprecated and replaced by
  `add_mentions` that should be called before `make_replacement`.

# 0.28.0

Bug fixes:

- The `MembershipState::Invite` to `MembershipState::Knock` membership change
  now returns `MembershipChange::Error`, due to a spec clarification

Breaking changes:

- The properties of `SecretStorageV1AesHmacSha2Properties` are now `Option`al.
- Remove `event_id` methods from relation types
- The required power level is different whether the user wants to redact their
  own event or an event from another user:
  -`RoomPowerLevels::user_can_redact` is split into `user_can_redact_own_event`
    and `user_can_redact_event_of_other`,
  - `PowerLevelAction::Redact` is split into `RedactOwn` and `RedactOther`.
- Use `OwnedRoomId` instead of `String` for the `state_key` field of `HierarchySpaceChildEvent`
- The `sdp_mid` and `sdp_m_line_index` fields of `Candidate` are now optional,
  for better compatibility with the WebRTC specification.

Improvements:

- Don't fail event content parsing on invalid relation
  - We previously already accepted custom or slightly malformed relations
  - Now, even invalid / missing `rel_type` and `event_id` are accepted
- Implement `From<RoomPowerLevels>` for `ruma_common::push::PushConditionPowerLevelsCtx`
- Add methods on `PowerLevels` to check if some actions are permitted based on
  the target user's power level.
- Add unstable support for manually marking rooms as unread through [MSC2867](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2867) 
  and the room account data `m.marked_unread` event (unstable type `com.famedly.marked_unread`)
- Implement `From<JoinRule>` for `SpaceRoomJoinRule`
- Add `filename` and `formatted` fields to media event contents to support media captions
  as per [MSC2530](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2530) / Matrix 1.10
- Add support for multi-stream VoIP, according to MSC3077 / Matrix 1.10

  (unstable type `org.matrix.msc4075.call.notify`)

# 0.27.10

Deprecations:

- Deprecate `event_id` methods on `Relation` types
  - They will be removed in the next breaking-change release
  - Please open an issue if you are currently using them

# 0.27.9

Bug fixes:

- Fix the name of the fallback text field for extensible events in
  `RoomMessageEventContentWithoutRelation::make_reply_to_raw()`

# 0.27.8

Improvements:

- Export the `UnstableAmplitude` type from the `room::message` module under the
  `unstable-msc3245-v1-compat` feature; it was previously unnameable

# 0.27.7

Improvements:

- Remove invalid `non_exhaustive` attribute on `call::member::MembershipInit`

# 0.27.6

Improvements:

- Add unstable support for `m.call.member` events
  (unstable type `org.matrix.msc3401.call.member`)

# 0.27.5

Improvements:

- Add the Ruma logo to the documentation as a favicon / sidebar logo

# 0.27.4

Improvements:

- Add `Thread::without_fallback` as a constructor that initializes the minimal
  set of required fields

# 0.27.3

Improvements:

- Improve compatibility of unstable voice messages

# 0.27.2

Improvements:

- Added constructors for `UnstableAudioDetailsContentBlock` and `UnstableVoiceContentBlock`

# 0.27.1

Improvements:

- Calling `make_reply_to` or `make_reply_to_raw` with `AddMentions::Yes` no longer adds people
  mentioned in the original message to mentions (only the sender of the original message)
- Add convenience constructors like `text_plain` to `RoomMessageEventContentWithoutRelation`
  - These are the same that are already available on `RoomMessageEventContent`
- Add methods on `RoomMessageEventWithoutRelation` that were previously only available on
  `RoomMessageEventContent`:
  - `make_reply_to`
  - `make_reply_to_raw`
  - `add_mentions`

# 0.27.0

The crate was split out of `ruma-common` again after `ruma-common 0.11.3`.

Bug fixes:

- Parse `m.tag` `order` as a f64 value or a stringified f64 value, if the `compat-tag-info` feature
  is enabled.

Breaking changes:

- Rename the `key` field in the `SecretStorageDefaultKeyEventContent` to
  `key_id`.
- Make `in_reply_to` field of `Thread` optional
  - It was wrong to be mandatory, spec was unclear (clarified [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1439))
- Remove `AnswerSessionDescription` and `OfferSessionDescription` types, use `SessionDescription`
  instead.
  - Remove `SessionDescriptionType`, use a `String` instead. A clarification in MSC2746 / Matrix 1.7
    explains that the `type` field should not be validated but passed as-is to the WebRTC API. It
    also avoids an unnecessary conversion between the WebRTC API and the Ruma type.
- The `reason` field in `CallHangupEventContent` is now required and defaults to `Reason::UserHangup`
  (MSC2746 / Matrix 1.7)
- The `Replacement` relation for `RoomMessageEventContent` now takes a
  `RoomMessageEventContentWithoutRelation` instead of a `MessageType`
- Make the `redacts` field of `Original(Sync)RoomRedactionEvent` optional to handle the format
  where the `redacts` key is moved inside the `content`, as introduced in room version 11,
  according to MSC2174 / MSC3820 / Matrix 1.8
    - `RoomRedactionEventContent::new()` was renamed to `new_v1()`, and `with_reason()` is no
      longer a constructor but a builder-type method
- Make the `creator` field of `RoomCreateEventContent` optional and deprecate it, as it was removed
  in room version 11, according to MSC2175 / MSC3820 / Matrix 1.8
    - `RoomCreateEventContent::new()` was renamed to `new_v1()`
    - `RedactedRoomCreateEventContent` is now a typedef over `RoomCreateEventContent`
- `RoomMessageEventContent::make_reply_to()` and `make_for_thread()` have an extra parameter to
  support the recommended behavior for intentional mentions in replies according to Matrix 1.7
- In Markdown, soft line breaks are transformed into hard line breaks when compiled into HTML.
- Move the HTML functions in `events::room::message::sanitize` to the ruma-html crate
  - The `unstable-sanitize` cargo feature was renamed to `html`
- Make `via` required in `Space(Child|Parent)EventContent` according to a spec clarification
- Make `name` required in `RoomNameEventContent`, the wording of the spec was confusing
- Rename `SecretEncryptionAlgorithm` to `SecretStorageEncryptionAlgorithm` and its
  `SecretStorageV1AesHmacSha2` variant to `V1AesHmacSha2`. This variant is also a tuple variant
  instead of a struct variant

Improvements:

- Add `InitialStateEvent::{new, to_raw, to_raw_any}`
- Add a convenience method to construct `RoomEncryptionEventContent` with the recommended defaults.
- Add `FullStateEventContent::redact`
- Add new methods for `RoomPowerLevels`:
  - `user_can_ban`
  - `user_can_invite`
  - `user_can_kick`
  - `user_can_redact`
  - `user_can_send_message`
  - `user_can_send_state`
  - `user_can_trigger_room_notification`
- Add `MessageType::sanitize` behind the `html` feature
- Stabilize support for annotations and reactions (MSC2677 / Matrix 1.7)
- Add support for intentional mentions push rules (MSC3952 / Matrix 1.7)
- Stabilize support for VoIP signalling improvements (MSC2746 / Matrix 1.7)
- Make the generated and stripped plain text reply fallback behavior more compatible with most
  of the Matrix ecosystem.
- Add support for intentional mentions according to MSC3952 / Matrix 1.7
- Add support for room version 11 according to MSC3820 / Matrix 1.8
  - Add preserved fields to match the new redaction algorithm, according to
    MSC2176 / MSC3821, for the following types:
    - `RedactedRoomRedactionEventContent`,
    - `RedactedRoomPowerLevelsEventContent`,
    - `RedactedRoomMemberEventContent`
- Add `RoomMessageEventContent::make_reply_to_raw` to build replies to any event
- Add support for custom `SecretStorageEncryptionAlgorithm`

# 0.26.1

Deprecation of the crate. It is now part of ruma-common 0.9.0.

# 0.26.0

Breaking changes:

* Bump versions of `ruma-common`, `ruma-idenfiers`

# 0.25.0

Breaking changes:

* Remove `RedactedStrippedStateEvent`
  * It was not used anywhere since stripped state events are never actually redacted
* Use `Box<RawJsonValue>` instead of `JsonValue` for PDU `content` field
* Require `room::message::MessageType` to always contain a body
  * The `new` constructor now also has a body parameter
* Rename `*ToDeviceEventContent` structs to `ToDevice*Content`
* Remove unneeded redacted event content enums
* Update `reply` and `html_reply` types to `impl Display` on `RoomMessageEventContent`'s reply
  constructors
* Remove the `custom` module, which has been redundant for a while
  * If you are still using it and are unclear on the upgrade path, please get in touch

Improvements:

* Add `is_allowed` to `RoomServerAclEventContent`
* Add `room::message::MessageType::body` accessor method
* Implement `Redact` for event structs (in addition to `Any` event enums)
* Add `room::message::RoomMessageEventContent::{body, msgtype}` accessor methods
* Move `room::message::MessageType::VerificationRequest` out of `unstable-pre-spec`
* Move MSC implementations from `unstable-pre-spec` to per-msc features:
  ```
  unstable-msc2448
  unstable-msc2675
  unstable-msc2676
  unstable-msc2677
  ```

# 0.24.6

Improvements:

* Add (unstable) support for [MSC3083](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/main/proposals/3083-restricted-rooms.md)

# 0.24.5

Improvements:

* Add `From` implementations for event and event content enums
* It's now an error for a `room::message::Relation` to be `Replaces` without
  there being `new_content`
  * Previously, this used to set the relation to `None`
* Unsupported relations are now deserialized to `relates_to: Some(_)` instead of
  `None`
  * It's not possible to inspect the inner value though

# 0.24.4

Improvements:

* Add a workaround for synapse putting `prev_content` in unsigned (only active
  if the `compat` feature is enabled)

# 0.24.3

Improvements:

* Add unstable support for `m.secret.request` and `m.secret.send` events

# 0.24.2

Improvements:

* Add missing constructor and `From` implementation for
  `EncryptedToDeviceEventContent`

# 0.24.1

Breaking changes:

* `room::name::NameEventContent` now uses a custom `RoomNameBox` type for its
  `name` field and makes it public, in response the constructor and `name`
  accessor had their types updated too
* Replace `InvalidEvent` by a more specific `FromStringError` for room name
  validation
* Remove unused `FromStrError`
* Remove deprecated method `room::name::NameEventContent::name`
* Make `encrypted::EncryptedToDeviceEventContent` its own type instead of a type
  alias for `EncryptedEventContent`
  * It doesn't have the `relates_to` field `EncryptedEventContent` has
* Upgrade dependencies

Improvements:

* Add the `StaticEventContent` trait for abstracting over event content struct
  types (with a type known at compile-time)

# 0.24.0

Yanked, was released too early missing another important breaking change.

# 0.23.3

Improvements:

* Add unstable blurhash field to member event content struct
* Add constructors for the unstable spaces parent and child event content types

Bug fixes:

* Remove `new_content` from the plain-text part of `m.encrypted` events
  * It is supposed to go into the encrypted payload, but we expected it in the
    plain-text part before.
  * This is technically a breaking change but since that can only be observed
    behind an unstable feature and this change doesn't break matrix-sdk, it's
    made in a point release.

# 0.23.2

Bug fixes:

* Fix reaction event (de)serialization (was broken in 0.23.0)

# 0.23.1

Improvements:

* Allow the macros exported by ruma-events to be used by crates that depend on matrix-sdk, but not
  (directly) on ruma or ruma-events

# 0.23.0

Breaking changes:

* Rename `key::verification::AcceptMethod::{MSasV1 => SasV1}`
* As above, drop `M` prefix from `key::verification::VerificationMethod` variants
  * Additionally, fix the name of the QR code one (`QrScanShowV1` to `QrCodeScanV1`)
* Remove `room::power_level::NotificationPowerLevels`, now found in `ruma_common::power_levels`
  (or `ruma::power_levels`)
* Remove `Custom` variant from event enums. If you were using this, please get in touch.
* Remove `Custom` variant from `key::verification::accept::AcceptMethod` and
  `key::verification::start::StartMethod`.
* Rename `relation` field in some events to `relates_to`
* All events that support relations now have their own `Relation` types (the `room::relationships`
  module has been removed)
  * The `room::encryption` relation type can represent any kind of relation and has `From`
    implementations so any other relation can be converted to it

Improvements:

* Add types for decrypted `m.room.encryption` event payloads (`DecryptedOlmV1Event`,
  `DecryptedMegolmV1Event`)
  * Currently, these don't have corresponding enums (and they might never get ones), instead to
    represent a decrypted event payload with an unknown event type use `AnyMessageEventContent` for
    the generic parameter

# 0.22.2

Improvements:

* Add unstable support for `m.space.child` and `m.space.parent` events

# 0.22.1

Bug fixes:

* Fix serialized format of `DummyEventContent`

# 0.22.0

Breaking changes:

* Change the structure of `StartEventContent` so that we can access transaction
  ids without the need to understand the concrete method.
* Change `get_message_events` limit field type from `Option<UInt>` to `UInt`
* Add `alt_aliases` to `CanonicalAliasEventContent`
* Replace `format` and `formatted_body` fields in `TextMessageEventContent`,
  `NoticeMessageEventContent` and `EmoteMessageEventContent` with `formatted: FormattedBody`
* Rename `override_rules` in `push_rules::Ruleset` to `override_`
* Change `push_rules::PushCondition` variants from newtype variants with separate inner types to
  struct variants
  * This change removes the types `EventMatchCondition`, `RoomMemberCountCondition` and
    `SenderNotificationPermissionCondition`
* Add PDU types: `pdu::{Pdu, PduStub}`
* `presence::PresenceState` has been moved. Import it from `ruma` or `ruma-common`.
* `EventJson` has been moved and renamed. Import it from `ruma` or `ruma-common`.
* The `in_reply_to` field of `room::message::RelatesTo` is now optional
* Use `ruma_identifiers::{ServerName, ServerKeyId}` in `signatures` fields of
  `pdu::RoomV1Pdu, RoomV1PduStub, RoomV3Pdu, RoomV3PduStub}` and
  `room::member::SignedContent`.
* Remove the `EventType::Custom` variant. You can still check for custom event types by going
  through `.as_str()`. This ensures that new event types doesn't break existing code.
* Remove the implementations of `From<EventType>` and `From<key::verification::cancel::CancelCode>`
  for `String`. Use the `Display` or `ToString` implementations for those types instead.
* Remove `PduStub`, `RoomV1PduStub` and `RoomV3PduStub` types
* Use `ruma_identifiers::MxcUri` instead of `String` for `avatar_url`, `thumbnail_url` or `url`
  fields in the following types:
  ```rust
  presence::PresenceEventContent,
  room::{
      avatar::{AvatarEventContent, ImageInfo},
      member::MemberEventContent,
      message::{
        AudioMessageEventContent, FileMessageEventContent, ImageMessageEventContent,
        VideoMessageEventContent
      }
      EncryptedFile, ImageInfo,
  },
  sticker::StickerEventContent
  ```
* Add `tag::TagName` type and use it for `tag::Tags`
* Move `FullyRead` from `EphemeralRoom` enum to `RoomAccountData` enum
* Split `Basic` enum into `GlobalAccountData` and `RoomAccountData` enums
  * Remove `DummyEvent`, `DummyEventContent`, `RoomKeyEvent`, `RoomKeyEventContent`
* Remove `BasicEventContent` trait and derive
* Make most of the types in this crate non-exhaustive

Improvements:

* Add `room::MessageFormat` and `room::FormattedBody`
* Skip serialization of optional values on `room::encryption::EncryptionEventContent`
* Rename `TextMessageEventContent::new_plain` to `plain` (the old name is still available, but
  deprecated)
* Add more constructors for types in `room::message`:
  * `TextMessageEventContent::html`
  * `NoticeMessageEventContent::plain`
  * `NoticeMessageEventContent::html`
  * `MessageEventContent::text_plain`
  * `MessageEventContent::text_html`
  * `MessageEventContent::notice_plain`
  * `MessageEventContent::notice_html`
* Add policy rule entities:
  * `policy::rule::room`
  * `policy::rule::server`
  * `policy::rule::user`
* Add policy rule recommendation:
  * `Recommendation::Ban`

# 0.21.3

Bug fixes:

* Fix `m.room.message` event serialization

Improvements:

* Skip serialization of `federate` field in `room::create::CreateEventContent`
  if it is `true` (the default value)
* `room::power_levels::PowerLevelsEventContent` now implements `Default`

# 0.21.2

Improvements:

* Update dependencies

# 0.21.1

Improvements:

* Add `EventJson::into_json`

# 0.21.0

Breaking changes:

* Replace `EventResult` with a new construct, `EventJson`
  * Instead of only capturing the json value if deserialization failed, we now
    now always capture it. To improve deserialization performance at the same
    time, we no longer use `serde_json::Value` internally and instead
    deserialize events as `Box<serde_json::value::RawValue>`. `EventJson` is
    simply a wrapper around that owned value type that additionally holds a
    generic argument: the type as which clients will usually want to deserialize
    the raw value.
* Add `struct UnsignedData` and update all `unsigned` fields types from
  `BTreeMap<String, Value>` to this new type.
  * To access any additional fields of the `unsigned` property of an event,
    deserialize the `EventJson` to another type that captures the field(s) you
    are interested in.
* Add fields `format` and `formatted_body` to `room::message::NoticeMessageEventContent`
* Remove `room::message::MessageType`
* Remove useless `algorithm` fields from encrypted event content structs
* Remove `PartialEq` implementations for most types
  * Since we're now using `serde_json::value::RawValue`, deriving no longer works
* Update the representation of `push_rules::Tweak`
* Raise minimum supported Rust version to 1.40.0

# 0.20.0

Improvements:

* Update ruma-identifiers to 0.16.0

# 0.19.0

Breaking changes:

* Update ruma-identifiers to 0.15.1
* Change timestamps, including `origin_server_rs` from `UInt` to `SystemTime`
* Change all usages of `HashMap` to `BTreeMap`
  * To support this, `EventType` now implements `PartialOrd` and `Ord`

# 0.18.0

Breaking changes:

* Update unsigned field's type from `Option<Value>` to `Map<String, Value>`

Improvements:

* Add a convenience constructor to create a plain-text `TextMessageEventContent`
* Add `m.dummy` events to the to-device event collection

# 0.17.0

Breaking changes:

* `collections::only` no longer exports a `raw` submodule. It was never meant to be exported in the first place.
* Renamed `stripped::{StrippedState => AnyStrippedStateEvent, StrippedStateContent => StrippedStateEvent}`

Improvements:

* Added `to_device` module with to-device variants of events (as found in the `to_device` section of a sync response)
* Added a helper method for computing the membership change from a `MemberEvent`

Bug fixes:

* Fixed missing `m.` in `m.relates_to` field of room messages
* Fixed (de)serialization of encrypted events using `m.olm.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2`

# 0.16.0

Breaking changes:

* `TryFromRaw::try_from_raw`'s signature has been simplified. The previous signature was a relict that was no longer sensible.
* All remaining non-optional `room_id` event fields (not event content fields) have been made optional

Improvements:

* `NameEvent`s are now validated properly and will be rejected if the `name` field is longer than 255 bytes.

# 0.15.1

Bug fixes:

* Deserialization of custom events as part of the types from `ruma_events::collections::{all, only}` was implemented (this was missing after the big fallible deserializion rewrite in 0.15.0)

# 0.15.0

Improvements:

* `ruma-events` now exports a new type, `EventResult`
  * For any event or event content type `T` inside a larger type that should support deserialization you can use `EventResult<T>` instead
  * Conceptually, it is the same as `Result<T, InvalidEvent>`
  * `InvalidEvent` can represent either a deserialization error (the event's structure did not match) or a validation error (some additional constraints defined in the matrix spec were violated)
    * It also contains the original value that was attempted to be deserialized into `T` in `serde_json::Value` form

Breaking changes:

* The `FromStr` implementations for event types were removed (they were the previous implementation of fallible deserialization, but were never integrated in ruma-client-api because they didn't interoperate well with serde derives)

# 0.14.0

Breaking changes:

* Updated to ruma-identifiers 0.14.0.

Improvements:

* ruma-events is now checked against the RustSec advisory database.

# 0.13.0

Breaking changes:

* Events and their content types no longer implement `Deserialize` and instead implement `FromStr` and `TryFrom<&str>`, which take a `&str` of JSON data and return a new `InvalidEvent` type on error.
* Integers are now represented using the `Int` and `UInt` types from the `js_int` crate to ensure they are within the JavaScript-interoperable range mandated by the Matrix specification.
* Some event types have new fields or new default values for previous fields to bring them up to date with version r0.5.0 of the client-server specification.
* Some event types no longer have public fields and instead use a constructor function to perform validations not represented by the type system.
* All enums now include a "nonexhaustive" variant to prevent exhaustive pattern matching. This will change to use the `#[nonexhaustive]` attribute when it is stabilized.
* `ParseError` has been renamed `FromStrError`.

New features:

* This release brings ruma-events completely up to date with version r0.5.0 of the client-server specification. All previously supported events have been updated as necessary and the following events have newly added support:
    * m.dummy
    * m.forwarded_room_key
    * m.fully_read
    * m.ignored_user_list
    * m.key.verification.accept
    * m.key.verification.cancel
    * m.key.verification.key
    * m.key.verification.mac
    * m.key.verification.request
    * m.key.verification.start
    * m.push_rules
    * m.key.encrypted
    * m.key.encryption
    * m.key.server_acl
    * m.key.tombstone
    * m.room_key
    * m.room_key_request
    * m.sticker

Improvements:

* Improved documentation for the crate and for many types.
* Added many new tests.
* rustfmt and clippy are now used to ensure consistent formatting and improved code quality.

# 0.12.0

Improvements:

* ruma-events now runs on stable Rust, requiring version 1.34 or higher.

Bug fixes:

* `CanonicalAliasEvent` and `NameEvent` now allow content being absent, null, or empty, as per the spec.

# 0.11.1

Breaking changes:

* `RoomId` is now optional in certain places where it may be absent, notably the responses of the `/sync` API endpoint.
* A `sender` field has been added to the `StrippedStateContent` type.

Improvements:

* Depend on serde's derive feature rather than serde_derive directly for simplified imports.
* Update to Rust 2018 idioms.

# 0.11.0

Breaking changes:

* The presence event has been modified to match the latest version of the spec. The spec was corrected to match the behavior of the Synapse homeserver.

Improvements:

* Dependencies have been updated to the latest versions.

# 0.10.0

Breaking changes:

* The `EventType`, and collections enums have new variants to support new events.
* The `extra_content` method has been removed from the Event trait.
* The `user_id` method from the `RoomEvent` trait has been renamed `sender` to match the specification.
* The `origin_server_ts` value is now required for room events and is supported via a new `origin_server_ts` method on the `RoomEvent` trait.
* `MemberEventContent` has a new `is_direct` field.
* `FileMessageEventContent` has a new `filename` field.
* File and thumbnail info have been moved from several message types to dedicated `FileInfo`, `ImageInfo`, and `ThumbnailInfo` types.
* `LocationMessageEventContent` has a new info field.
* `PresenceEventContent`'s `currently_active` field has changed from `bool` to `Option`.
* `TypingEventContent` contains a vector of `UserId`s instead of `EventId`s.
* Height and width fields named `h` and `w` in the spec now use the full names `height` and `width` for their struct field names, but continue to serialize to the single-letter names.

New features:

* ruma-events now supports all events according to r0.3.0 of the Matrix client-server specification.
* Added new event: `m.room.pinned_events`.
* Added new event: `m.direct`.

Bug fixes:

* Several places where struct fields used the wrong key when serialized to JSON have been corrected.
* Fixed grammar issues in documentation.
