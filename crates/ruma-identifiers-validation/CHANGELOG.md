# [unreleased]

# 0.9.5

Bug fixes:

- Allow underscores (`_`) when validating MXC URIs.
  - They have always been allowed in the spec in order to support URL-safe
    base64-encoded media IDs.

Improvements:

- Point links to the Matrix 1.10 specification

# 0.9.4

Yanked because it was created from the wrong branch

# 0.9.3

Improvements:

- Don't require room IDs to contain a server name
  - Room IDs being splittable into localpart and servername does not have
    much inherent value and there are proposals like [MSC4051] that propose
    changing the format. Relaxing the rules makes Ruma forwards-compatible
    with those proposals. The server_name accessor is kept because it is
    used by at least one downstream, but is updated to return an `Option`.

[MSC4051]: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4051

# 0.9.2

Bug fixes:

- Don't consider empty localpart of a user ID as valid
  - It is accepted under the `compat-user-id` feature, but not considered
    fully-conforming

Improvements:

- Allow `+` in the localpart of user IDs according to MSC4009 / Matrix 1.8
- Add `compat-arbitrary-length-ids` Cargo feature for opting out of 255-byte
  length check for all ID types

# 0.9.1

Improvements:

* Update links to the latest version of the Matrix spec

# 0.9.0

Breaking changes:

* Remove `room_name` module
  * Room name size limits were never enforced, so they are now just regular
    `String`s in Ruma ([Spec change removing the size limit][spec])
