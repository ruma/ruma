# [unreleased]

Breaking changes:

- `Algorithm` is replaced by `SigningKeyAlgorithm` from `ruma-common`.
  - `Signature::new()` returns an `IdParseError`.
  - `Error::UnsupportedAlgorithm` is removed since it is now unused.
- The `compat-signature-id` cargo feature was removed. No validation is done on
  the key name of a key ID, to stop assuming that this crate is only used to
  check server signatures.
- The variants of `VerificationError` were changed to be clearer, have more
  details about the error, and to support any type of entity.
- `JsonError::JsonKeyMissing` was replaced by
  `VerificationError::PublicKeyNotFound`
- `reference_hash` and `verify_event` take `RoomVersionRules` instead of
  `RoomVersionId`. This avoids undefined behavior for unknown room versions.
- `hash_and_sign_event` take `RedactionRules` instead of `RoomVersionId`. This
  avoids undefined behavior for unknown room versions.
- The `ServerNameFromEventIdByRoomVersion` variant of `ParseError` was renamed
  to `ServerNameFromEventId`, and doesn't hold a `RoomVersionId` anymore.

Improvements:

- Add `verify_canonical_json_bytes()` as a low-level function to check the
  signature of canonical JSON bytes

Bug fixes:

- Do not check the signature of the server of the sender of `m.room.member`
  invite events with a `third_party_invite` field.

# 0.17.0

Improvements:

- The `unstable-exhaustive-types` cargo feature was replaced by the
  `ruma_unstable_exhaustive_types` compile-time `cfg` setting. Like all `cfg`
  settings, it can be enabled at compile-time with the `RUSTFLAGS` environment
  variable, or inside `.cargo/config.toml`. It can also be enabled by setting
  the `RUMA_UNSTABLE_EXHAUSTIVE_TYPES` environment variable.

# 0.16.0

Upgrade `ruma-common` to 0.14.0.

# 0.15.0

No changes for this version

# 0.14.0

Breaking changes:

- Update `ed25519-dalek` crate
  - `Ed25519KeyPair::generate()` returns a `Zeroizing<Vec<u8>>` on success
  - `Ed25519KeyPair::public_key()` returns an array instead of a slice

Bug fixes:

- Ignore keys with unknown algorithms in `verify_events`

Improvements:

- Remove `age_ts` from `REFERENCE_HASH_FIELDS_TO_REMOVE` according to a spec clarification
