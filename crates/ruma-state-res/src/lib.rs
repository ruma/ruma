//! State resolution and checks on incoming PDUs according to the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) specification.
//!
//! When creating or receiving a PDU (or event), a server must check whether it is valid and how it
//! affects the room state. The purpose of this crate is to provide functions that solve that.
//!
//! # Checks performed on receipt of a PDU
//!
//! This crate used with [ruma-signatures] should allow to perform all the [necessary checks on
//! receipt of a PDU].
//!
//! To respect the Matrix specification, the following functions should be called for a PDU:
//!
//! 1. [`check_pdu_format()`] - The event should be dropped on error.
//! 2. [`ruma_signatures::verify_event()`] - The event should be dropped on error. The PDU should be
//!    redacted before checking the authorization rules if the result is `Verified::Signatures`.
//! 3. [`check_state_independent_auth_rules()`] - The event should be rejected on error.
//! 4. [`check_state_dependent_auth_rules()`] - This function must be called 3 times:
//!     1. With the `auth_events` for the state, the event should be rejected on error.
//!     2. With the state before the event, the event should be rejected on error.
//!     3. With the current state of the room, the event should be "soft failed" on error.
//!
//! # Room State Resolution
//!
//! Because of the distributed nature of Matrix, homeservers might not receive all events in the
//! same order, which might cause the room state to diverge temporarily between homeservers. The
//! purpose of [state resolution] is to make sure that all homeservers arrive at the same room state
//! given the same events.
//!
//! The [`resolve()`] function allows to do that. It takes an iterator of state maps and applies the
//! proper state resolution algorithm for the current room version to output the map of events in
//! the current room state.
//!
//! # Event helper types
//!
//! The types from [ruma-events] use strict deserialization rules according to their definition in
//! the specification, which means that they also validate fields that are not checked when
//! receiving a PDU. Since it is not appropriate for servers to reject an event that passes those
//! checks, this crate provides helper types in the [`events`] module, built around the [`Event`]
//! trait, to deserialize lazily a handful of fields from the most common state events. Since these
//! are the same types used for checking the authorization rules, they are guaranteed to not perform
//! extra validation on unvalidated fields.
//!
//! The types from ruma-events are still appropriate to be used to create a new event, or to
//! validate an event received from a client.
