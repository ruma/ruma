//! Types and traits for working with the [Matrix](https://matrix.org) protocol.
//!
//! This crate re-exports things from all of the other ruma crates so you don't
//! have to manually keep all the versions in sync.
//!
//! Which crates are re-exported can be configured through cargo features.
//!
//! > âš  Some details might be missing because rustdoc has trouble with re-exports so you may need
//! > to refer to other crates' documentations.
//!
//! > ðŸ›ˆ For internal consistency, Ruma uses American spelling for variable names. Names may differ
//! > in the serialized representation, as the Matrix specification has a mix of British and
//! > American English.
//!
//! # API features
//!
//! Depending on which parts of Matrix are relevant to you, activate the following features:
//!
//! * `appservice-api` -- Application Service API.
//! * `client-api` -- Client-Server API.
//! * `federation-api` -- Server-Server (Federation) API.
//! * `identity-service-api` -- Identity Service API.
//! * `push-gateway-api` -- Push Gateway API.
//!
//! These features have `client`- and `server`-optimized variants that are enabled respectively
//! with the `-c` and `-s` suffixes. For example:
//!   * `client-api-c` -- The Client-Server API optimized for the client side.
//!   * `client-api-s` -- The Client-Server API optimized for the server side.
//!
//! # Compatibility features
//!
//! By default, the ruma crates are only able to handle strictly spec-compliant data and behaviour.
//! However, due to the fact that Matrix is federated, that it is used by various implementations
//! that might have different bugs, and that much of its data is immutable, they need to be able to
//! interoperate with data that might differ slightly from the specification.
//!
//! This is the role of the `compat-*` cargo features. They allow the crates be more tolerant of
//! external data and incoming requests for known and reasonable deviations from the spec, usually
//! for historical reasons. They however do not permit the ruma crates to generate data that is not
//! spec-compliant.
//!
//! Each cargo feature is documented briefly in the cargo manifest of the crate, and more thoroughly
//! where the feature applies.
//!
//! # Convenience features
//!
//! These features are only useful if you want to use a method that requires it:
//!
//! * `rand` -- Generate random identifiers.
//! * `markdown` -- Parse markdown to construct messages.
//! * `html` -- Parse HTML to sanitize it or navigate its tree.
//!   * `html-matrix` -- Enables the `matrix` feature of `ruma-html` to parse HTML elements data to
//!     typed data as suggested by the Matrix Specification.
//!
//! # Unstable features
//!
//! By using these features, you opt out of all semver guarantees Ruma otherwise provides:
//!
//! * `unstable-mscXXXX`, where `XXXX` is the MSC number -- Upcoming Matrix features that may be
//!   subject to change or removal.
//!
//! # Common features
//!
//! These submodules are usually activated by the API features when needed:
//!
//! * `api`
//! * `events`
//! * `signatures`
//!
//! # Compile-time `cfg` settings
//!
//! These settings are accepted at compile time to configure the generated code. They can be set as
//! `--cfg={key}={value}` using `RUSTFLAGS` or `.cargo/config.toml` (under `[build]` -> `rustflags =
//! ["..."]`). They can also be configured using an environment variable at compile time, which has
//! the benefit of not requiring to re-compile the whole dependency chain when their value is
//! changed.
//!
//! * `ruma_identifiers_storage` -- Choose the inner representation of `Owned*` wrapper types for
//!   identifiers. By default they use [`Box`], setting the value to `Arc` makes them use
//!   [`Arc`](std::sync::Arc). This can also be configured by setting the `RUMA_IDENTIFIERS_STORAGE`
//!   environment variable.
//! * `ruma_unstable_exhaustive_types` -- Most types in Ruma are marked as non-exhaustive to avoid
//!   breaking changes when new fields are added in the specification. This setting compiles all
//!   types as exhaustive. By enabling this feature you opt out of all semver guarantees Ruma
//!   otherwise provides. This can also be configured by setting the
//!   `RUMA_UNSTABLE_EXHAUSTIVE_TYPES` environment variable.
