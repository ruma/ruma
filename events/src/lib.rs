//! (De)serializable types for the events in the [Matrix](https://matrix.org) specification.
//! These types are used by other ruma crates.
//!
//! All data exchanged over Matrix is expressed as an event.
//! Different event types represent different actions, such as joining a room or sending a message.
//! Events are stored and transmitted as simple JSON structures.
//! While anyone can create a new event type for their own purposes, the Matrix specification
//! defines a number of event types which are considered core to the protocol, and Matrix clients
//! and servers must understand their semantics.
//! ruma-events contains Rust types for each of the event types defined by the specification and
//! facilities for extending the event system for custom event types.
//!
//! # Event types
//!
//! ruma-events includes a Rust enum called `EventType`, which provides a simple enumeration of
//! all the event types defined by the Matrix specification. Matrix event types are serialized to
//! JSON strings in [reverse domain name
//! notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation), although the core event
//! types all use the special "m" TLD, e.g. *m.room.message*.
//!
//! # Core event types
//!
//! ruma-events includes Rust types for every one of the event types in the Matrix specification.
//! To better organize the crate, these types live in separate modules with a hierarchy that
//! matches the reverse domain name notation of the event type.
//! For example, the *m.room.message* event lives at `ruma_events::room::message::MessageEvent`.
//! Each type's module also contains a Rust type for that event type's `content` field, and any
//! other supporting types required by the event's other fields.
//!
//! # Extending Ruma with custom events
//!
//! For our example we will create a reaction message event. This can be used with ruma-events
//! structs, for this event we will use a `SyncMessageEvent` struct but any `MessageEvent` struct
//! would work.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use ruma_events::{macros::MessageEventContent, SyncMessageEvent};
//! use ruma_identifiers::EventId;
//! use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
//!
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
//! #[serde(tag = "rel_type")]
//! pub enum RelatesTo {
//!     #[serde(rename = "m.annotation")]
//!     Annotation {
//!         /// The event this reaction relates to.
//!         event_id: EventId,
//!         /// The displayable content of the reaction.
//!         key: String,
//!     },
//!
//!     /// Since this event is not fully specified in the Matrix spec
//!     /// it may change or types may be added, we are ready!
//!     #[serde(rename = "m.whatever")]
//!     Whatever,
//! }
//!
//! /// The payload for our reaction event.
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Deserialize, Serialize, MessageEventContent)]
//! #[ruma_event(type = "m.reaction")]
//! pub struct ReactionEventContent {
//!     #[serde(rename = "m.relates_to")]
//!     pub relates_to: RelatesTo,
//! }
//!
//! let json = serde_json::json!({
//!     "content": {
//!         "m.relates_to": {
//!             "event_id": "$xxxx-xxxx",
//!             "key": "üëç",
//!             "rel_type": "m.annotation"
//!         }
//!     },
//!     "event_id": "$xxxx-xxxx",
//!     "origin_server_ts": 1,
//!     "sender": "@someone:example.org",
//!     "type": "m.reaction",
//!     "unsigned": {
//!         "age": 85
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! // The downside of this event is we cannot use it with the `AnyRoomEvent` or `AnyEvent` enums,
//! // but could be deserialized from a `Raw<AnyRoomEvent>` that has failed.
//! matches::assert_matches!(
//!     serde_json::from_value::<SyncMessageEvent<ReactionEventContent>>(json),
//!     Ok(SyncMessageEvent {
//!         content: ReactionEventContent {
//!             relates_to: RelatesTo::Annotation { key, .. },
//!         },
//!         ..
//!     }) if key == "üëç"
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! # Serialization and deserialization
//!
//! All concrete event types in ruma-events can be serialized via the `Serialize` trait from
//! [serde](https://serde.rs/) and can be deserialized from as `Raw<EventType>`. In order to
//! handle incoming data that may not conform to `ruma-events`' strict definitions of event
//! structures, deserialization will return `Raw::Err` on error. This error covers both
//! structurally invalid JSON data as well as structurally valid JSON that doesn't fulfill
//! additional constraints the matrix specification defines for some event types. The error exposes
//! the deserialized `serde_json::Value` so that developers can still work with the received
//! event data. This makes it possible to deserialize a collection of events without the entire
//! collection failing to deserialize due to a single invalid event. The "content" type for each
//! event also implements `Serialize` and either `TryFromRaw` (enabling usage as
//! `Raw<ContentType>` for dedicated content types) or `Deserialize` (when the content is a
//! type alias), allowing content to be converted to and from JSON independently of the surrounding
//! event structure, if needed.
