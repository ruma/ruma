//! Crate `ruma_api` contains core types used to define the requests and responses for each endpoint
//! in the various [Matrix](https://matrix.org) API specifications.
//! These types can be shared by client and server code for all Matrix APIs.
//!
//! When implementing a new Matrix API, each endpoint has a request type which implements
//! `Endpoint`, and a response type connected via an associated type.
//!
//! An implementation of `Endpoint` contains all the information about the HTTP method, the path and
//! input parameters for requests, and the structure of a successful response.
//! Such types can then be used by client code to make requests, and by server code to fulfill
//! those requests.

/// Generates a `ruma_api::Endpoint` from a concise definition.
///
/// The macro expects the following structure as input:
///
/// ```text
/// ruma_api! {
///     metadata: {
///         description: &'static str,
///         method: http::Method,
///         name: &'static str,
///         path: &'static str,
///         rate_limited: bool,
///         authentication: ruma_api::AuthScheme,
///     }
///
///     request: {
///         // Struct fields for each piece of data required
///         // to make a request to this API endpoint.
///     }
///
///     response: {
///         // Struct fields for each piece of data expected
///         // in the response from this API endpoint.
///     }
///
///     // The error returned when a response fails, defaults to `Void`.
///     error: path::to::Error
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This will generate a `ruma_api::Metadata` value to be used for the `ruma_api::Endpoint`'s
/// associated constant, single `Request` and `Response` structs, and the necessary trait
/// implementations to convert the request into a `http::Request` and to create a response from a
/// `http::Response` and vice versa.
///
/// The details of each of the three sections of the macros are documented below.
///
/// ## Metadata
///
/// *   `description`: A short description of what the endpoint does.
/// *   `method`: The HTTP method used for requests to the endpoint.
///     It's not necessary to import `http::Method`'s associated constants. Just write
///     the value as if it was imported, e.g. `GET`.
/// *   `name`: A unique name for the endpoint.
///     Generally this will be the same as the containing module.
/// *   `path`: The path component of the URL for the endpoint, e.g. "/foo/bar".
///     Components of the path that are parameterized can indicate a varible by using a Rust
///     identifier prefixed with a colon, e.g. `/foo/:some_parameter`.
///     A corresponding query string parameter will be expected in the request struct (see below
///     for details).
/// *   `rate_limited`: Whether or not the endpoint enforces rate limiting on requests.
/// *   `authentication`: What authentication scheme the endpoint uses.
///
/// ## Request
///
/// The request block contains normal struct field definitions.
/// Doc comments and attributes are allowed as normal.
/// There are also a few special attributes available to control how the struct is converted into a
/// `http::Request`:
///
/// *   `#[ruma_api(header = HEADER_NAME)]`: Fields with this attribute will be treated as HTTP
///     headers on the request.
///     The value must implement `AsRef<str>`.
///     Generally this is a `String`.
///     The attribute value shown above as `HEADER_NAME` must be a header name constant from
///     `http::header`, e.g. `CONTENT_TYPE`.
/// *   `#[ruma_api(path)]`: Fields with this attribute will be inserted into the matching path
///     component of the request URL.
/// *   `#[ruma_api(query)]`: Fields with this attribute will be inserting into the URL's query
///     string.
/// *   `#[ruma_api(query_map)]`: Instead of individual query fields, one query_map field, of any
///     type that implements `IntoIterator<Item = (String, String)>` (e.g.
///     `HashMap<String, String>`, can be used for cases where an endpoint supports arbitrary query
///     parameters.
///
/// Any field that does not include one of these attributes will be part of the request's JSON
/// body.
///
/// ## Response
///
/// Like the request block, the response block consists of normal struct field definitions.
/// Doc comments and attributes are allowed as normal.
/// There is also a special attribute available to control how the struct is created from a
/// `http::Request`:
///
/// *   `#[ruma_api(header = HEADER_NAME)]`: Fields with this attribute will be treated as HTTP
///     headers on the response.
///     The value must implement `AsRef<str>`.
///     Generally this is a `String`.
///     The attribute value shown above as `HEADER_NAME` must be a header name constant from
///     `http::header`, e.g. `CONTENT_TYPE`.
///
/// Any field that does not include the above attribute will be expected in the response's JSON
/// body.
///
/// ## Newtype bodies
///
/// Both the request and response block also support "newtype bodies" by using the
/// `#[ruma_api(body)]` attribute on a field. If present on a field, the entire request or response
/// body will be treated as the value of the field. This allows you to treat the entire request or
/// response body as a specific type, rather than a JSON object with named fields. Only one field in
/// each struct can be marked with this attribute. It is an error to have a newtype body field and
/// normal body fields within the same struct.
///
/// There is another kind of newtype body that is enabled with `#[ruma_api(raw_body)]`. It is used
/// for endpoints in which the request or response body can be arbitrary bytes instead of a JSON
/// objects. A field with `#[ruma_api(raw_body)]` needs to have the type `Vec<u8>`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// pub mod some_endpoint {
///     use ruma_api_macros::ruma_api;
///
///     ruma_api! {
///         metadata: {
///             description: "Does something.",
///             method: POST,
