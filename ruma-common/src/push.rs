//! Common types for the [push notifications module][push]
//!
//! [push]: https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1#id89
//!
//! ## Understanding the types of this module
//!
//! Push rules are grouped in `RuleSet`s, and are grouped in five kinds (for
//! more details about the different kind of rules, see the `Ruleset` documentation,
//! or the specification). These five kinds are:
//!
//! - content rules
//! - override rules
//! - underride rules
//! - room rules
//! - sender rules
//!
//! Each of these kind of rule has a corresponding type that is
//! just a wrapper around another type:
//!
//! - `SimplePushRule` for room and sender rules
//! - `ConditionalPushRule` for override and underride rules: push rules that may depend on a
//!   condition
//! - `PatternedPushRules` for content rules, that can filter events based on a pattern to trigger
//!   the rule or not
//!
//! Having these wrapper types allows to tell at the type level what kind of rule you are
//! handling, and makes sure the `Ruleset::add` method adds your rule to the correct field
//! of `Ruleset`, and that rules that are not of the same kind are never mixed even if they share
//! the same representation.
//!
//! It is still possible to write code that is generic over a representation by manipulating
//! `SimplePushRule`, `ConditonalPushRule` or `PatternedPushRule` directly, instead of the wrappers.
//!
//! There is also the `AnyPushRule` type that is the most generic form of push rule, with all
//! the possible fields.
