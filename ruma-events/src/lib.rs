//! Crate `ruma_events` contains serializable types for the events in the
//! [Matrix](https://matrix.org) specification that can be shared by client and server code.
//!
//! All data exchanged over Matrix is expressed as an event.
//! Different event types represent different actions, such as joining a room or sending a message.
//! Events are stored and transmitted as simple JSON structures.
//! While anyone can create a new event type for their own purposes, the Matrix specification
//! defines a number of event types which are considered core to the protocol, and Matrix clients
//! and servers must understand their semantics.
//! ruma-events contains Rust types for each of the event types defined by the specification and
//! facilities for extending the event system for custom event types.
//!
//! # Event types
//!
//! ruma-events includes a Rust enum called `EventType`, which provides a simple enumeration of
//! all the event types defined by the Matrix specification. Matrix event types are serialized to
//! JSON strings in [reverse domain name
//! notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation), although the core event
//! types all use the special "m" TLD, e.g. *m.room.message*.
//! `EventType` also includes a variant called `Custom`, which is a catch-all that stores a string
//! containing the name of any event type that isn't part of the specification.
//! `EventType` is used throughout ruma-events to identify and differentiate between events of
//! different types.
//!
//! # Event kinds
//!
//! Matrix defines three "kinds" of events:
//!
//! 1.  **Events**, which are arbitrary JSON structures that have two required keys:
//!     * `type`, which specifies the event's type
//!     * `content`, which is a JSON object containing the "payload" of the event
//! 2.  **Room events**, which are a superset of events and represent actions that occurred within
//!     the context of a Matrix room.
//!     They have at least the following additional keys:
//!     * `event_id`, which is a unique identifier for the event
//!     * `room_id`, which is a unique identifier for the room in which the event occurred
//!     * `sender`, which is the unique identifier of the Matrix user who created the event
//!     * Optionally, `unsigned`, which is a JSON object containing arbitrary additional metadata
//!     that is not digitally signed by Matrix homeservers.
//! 3.  **State events**, which are a superset of room events and represent persistent state
//!     specific to a room, such as the room's member list or topic.
//!     Within a single room, state events of the same type and with the same "state key" will
//!     effectively "replace" the previous one, updating the room's state.
//!     They have at least the following additional keys:
//!     * `state_key`, a string which serves as a sort of "sub-type." The state key allows a room to
//!       persist multiple state events of the same type. You can think of a room's state events as
//!       being a `BTreeMap` where the keys are the tuple `(event_type, state_key)`.
//!     * Optionally, `prev_content`, a JSON object containing the `content` object from the
//!     previous event of the given `(event_type, state_key)` tuple in the given room.
//!
//! ruma-events represents these three event kinds as traits, allowing any Rust type to serve as a
//! Matrix event so long as it upholds the contract expected of its kind.
//!
//! # Core event types
//!
//! ruma-events includes Rust types for every one of the event types in the Matrix specification.
//! To better organize the crate, these types live in separate modules with a hierarchy that
//! matches the reverse domain name notation of the event type.
//! For example, the *m.room.message* event lives at `ruma_events::room::message::MessageEvent`.
//! Each type's module also contains a Rust type for that event type's `content` field, and any
//! other supporting types required by the event's other fields.
//!
//! # Custom event types
//!
//! Although any Rust type that implements `Event`, `RoomEvent`, or `StateEvent` can serve as a
//! Matrix event type, ruma-events also includes a few convenience types for representing events
//! that are not covered by the spec and not otherwise known by the application.
//! `CustomEvent`, `CustomRoomEvent`, and `CustomStateEvent` are simple implementations of their
//! respective event traits whose `content` field is simply a `serde_json::Value` value, which
//! represents arbitrary JSON.
//!
//! ## Extending Ruma with custom events
//!
//! For our example we will create a reaction message event. This can be used with ruma-events
//! structs, for this event we will use a `SyncMessageEvent` struct but any `MessageEvent` struct
//! would work.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use ruma_events::{macros::MessageEventContent, SyncMessageEvent};
//! use ruma_identifiers::EventId;
//! use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
//!
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
//! #[serde(tag = "rel_type")]
//! pub enum RelatesTo {
//!     #[serde(rename = "m.annotation")]
//!     Annotation {
//!         /// The event this reaction relates to.
//!         event_id: EventId,
//!         /// The displayable content of the reaction.
//!         key: String,
//!     },
//!
//!     /// Since this event is not fully specified in the Matrix spec
//!     /// it may change or types may be added, we are ready!
//!     #[serde(rename = "m.whatever")]
//!     Whatever,
//! }
//!
//! /// The payload for our reaction event.
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Deserialize, Serialize, MessageEventContent)]
//! #[ruma_event(type = "m.reaction")]
//! pub struct ReactionEventContent {
//!     #[serde(rename = "m.relates_to")]
//!     pub relates_to: RelatesTo,
//! }
//!
//! let json = serde_json::json!({
//!     "content": {
//!         "m.relates_to": {
//!             "event_id": "$xxxx-xxxx",
//!             "key": "üëç",
//!             "rel_type": "m.annotation"
//!         }
//!     },
//!     "event_id": "$xxxx-xxxx",
//!     "origin_server_ts": 1,
//!     "sender": "@someone:example.org",
//!     "type": "m.reaction",
//!     "unsigned": {
//!         "age": 85
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! // The downside of this event is we cannot use it with the `AnyRoomEvent` or `AnyEvent` enums,
//! // but could be deserialized from a `Raw<AnyRoomEvent>` that has failed.
//! matches::assert_matches!(
//!     serde_json::from_value::<SyncMessageEvent<ReactionEventContent>>(json),
//!     Ok(SyncMessageEvent {
//!         content: ReactionEventContent {
//!             relates_to: RelatesTo::Annotation { key, .. },
//!         },
//!         ..
//!     }) if key == "üëç"
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! # Serialization and deserialization
//!
//! All concrete event types in ruma-events can be serialized via the `Serialize` trait from
//! [serde](https://serde.rs/) and can be deserialized from as `Raw<EventType>`. In order to
//! handle incoming data that may not conform to `ruma-events`' strict definitions of event
//! structures, deserialization will return `Raw::Err` on error. This error covers both
//! structurally invalid JSON data as well as structurally valid JSON that doesn't fulfill
//! additional constraints the matrix specification defines for some event types. The error exposes
//! the deserialized `serde_json::Value` so that developers can still work with the received
//! event data. This makes it possible to deserialize a collection of events without the entire
//! collection failing to deserialize due to a single invalid event. The "content" type for each
//! event also implements `Serialize` and either `TryFromRaw` (enabling usage as
//! `Raw<ContentType>` for dedicated content types) or `Deserialize` (when the content is a
//! type alias), allowing content to be converted to and from JSON independently of the surrounding
//! event structure, if needed.
//!
//! # Collections
//!
//! With the trait-based approach to events, it's easy to write generic collection types like
//! `Vec<Box<R: RoomEvent>>`.
//! However, there are APIs in the Matrix specification that involve heterogeneous collections of
//! events, i.e. a list of events of different event types.
//! Because Rust does not have a facility for arrays, vectors, or slices containing multiple
//! concrete types, ruma-events provides special collection types for this purpose.
//! The collection types are enums which effectively "wrap" each possible event type of a
//! particular event "kind."
//!
//! Because of the hierarchical nature of event kinds in Matrix, these collection types are divied
//! into two modules, `ruma_events::collections::all` and `ruma_events::collections::only`.
//! The "all" versions include every event type that implements the relevant event trait as well as
//! more specific event traits.
//! The "only" versions include only the event types that implement "at most" the relevant event
//! trait.
//!
//! For example, the `ruma_events::collections::all::Event` enum includes *m.room.message*, because
//! that event type is both an event and a room event.
//! However, the `ruma_events::collections::only::Event` enum does *not* include *m.room.message*,
//! because *m.room.message* implements a *more specific* event trait than `Event`.
