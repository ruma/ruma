//! Types for persistent data unit schemas
//!
//! The differences between the `RoomV1Pdu` schema and the `RoomV3Pdu` schema are
//! that the `RoomV1Pdu` takes an `event_id` field (`RoomV3Pdu` does not), and
//! `auth_events` and `prev_events` take `Vec<(EventId, EventHash)> rather than
//! `Vec<EventId>` in `RoomV3Pdu`.
//!
//! The stubbed versions of each PDU type remove the `event_id` field (if any)
//! and the `room_id` field for use in PDU templates.
