//! Types and traits for working with the Matrix protocol.
//!
//! This crate re-exports things from all of the other ruma crates so you don't
//! have to manually keep all the versions in sync.
//!
//! Which crates are re-exported can be configured through cargo features.
//! Depending on which parts of Matrix are relevant to you, activate the
//! following features:
//!
//! * `client-api` for the client-server API
//! * `federation-api` for the server-server (federation) API
//! * `appservice-api` for the application service API
