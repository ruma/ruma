# Ruma xtasks

This crate is a helper bin for repetitive tasks during Ruma development, based on [cargo-xtask].

To use it, run `cargo xtask [command]` anywhere in the workspace.

Some commands need configuration variables. Copy `config.toml.sample` to `config.toml` and fill
the appropriate fields.

## Commands

- `release [crate]`: Publish `crate`, create a signed tag based on its name and version and create
  a release on GitHub. **Requires all `github` fields in `config.toml`.**
