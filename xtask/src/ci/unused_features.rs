///   dependency, because the feature will be checked in that crate. Unstable features have a
///   stricter rule because we assume that they are always used to trigger a different behavior
///   *inside* this workspace. This criterion can be relaxed if there is an actual use for a
///   different behavior *outside* this workspace.
/// - If it is another cargo feature, it enables a dependency or a cargo feature in a dependency.
/// - We can find the cargo feature name in a Rust file in the `src` directory of the crate with a
///   string search.
///
/// Requires `grep` to be available on the machine.
